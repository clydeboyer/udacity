<h1>Clyde's Notes</h1>
<p>I've made my own web pages over the years, so this was definitely just a refresher. This is the tough spot I'm in. I've gone over introductory content so many times, I've lost count. But I haven't stuck with any advanced course of study. I guess slogging through this intro is the price I pay :)</p>
<h3>World Wide Web</h3>
<p>The primary concepts covered were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP is the primary Web protocol</li>
  <li>Servers host the documents access on the web</li>
</ul>
<h3>HTML Basics</h3>
<b>HTML Tags</b>
<p>HTML markup is made up of tags; an opening tag and closing tag. The primary tags we reviewed were as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bold tag</b></li>
    <li><em>Italics tag</em></li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp">link tag</a></li>
    <li>The image tag <img src="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/icons/sport_soccer.png" alt="Soccer ball"></li>
    <li> and the humble paragraph tag</li>
  </ul>
<b>Inline vs Block elements</b>
  <p> Block elements have an invisible line around the element and can height and width.</p>
  <p>Span tags are inline and Div elements are block level.</p>

  <b>Document Structure</b>
  <p> !DOCTYPE HTML opens the document and designates the document to follow as HTML. The <b>head</b> tag defines metadata for the document like title.</p>
